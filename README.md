# GDES 5342 Final Project

This app/website is supposed to be an online 'library" of stories in the superhero genre. The home page, main arcs page, and solo comics page that show shelves of different books to read. Clicking on a story will lead to a story page for each book. There is also a character database meant to show off the characters that appear in the books.
